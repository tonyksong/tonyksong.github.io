I am a creative and innovative Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer in NYC. M.S. in Analytics '20 graduate from Georgia Institute of Technology. I love all things machine learning and data visualization!

When I'm not working, I'm probably [playing guitar](http://www.tonysongmusic.com/) at home or around town. I also love reading fiction and geeking out over food and wine.
