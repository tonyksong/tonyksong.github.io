I"”<p>With the world going through the COVID-19 pandemic, and given that Iâ€™m in NYC, which is the epicenter of the outbreak here in the U.S., I thought it would be a fun exercise to track the number of cases and deaths in NYC. There are a lot of great visualizations out there, and Iâ€™ve been checking the <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">COVID-19 Dashboard by JHU CSSE</a>, but I wanted an easier, faster way to just see the information for NYC.</p>

<p>I found a data source from New York Times that gets updated daily on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data</a>). From this data, I used D3.js (which I learned in my course CSE 6242 Data Analytics and Visualization at Georgia Tech) to create a simple interactive plot that tracks the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in NYC. Check it out <a href="https://tonyksong.github.io/covid19nyc.html">here!</a></p>
