I"<p>With the world going through the COVID-19 pandemic, and given that I’m in NYC, which is the epicenter of the outbreak here in the U.S., I thought it would be a fun exercise to track the number of cases and deaths in NYC. There are a lot of great visualizations out there, and I’ve been checking the <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">COVID-19 Dashboard by JHU CSSE</a>, but I wanted an easier, faster way to just see the information for NYC.</p>
